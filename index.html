        <p>
            Yophish is a <strong>cybersecurity awareness training tool</strong> designed to help 
            organizations safely simulate phishing attacks for educational purposes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our platform sends <strong>simulated phishing emails</strong> to employees to measure 
            awareness levels and teach best practices for recognizing social engineering attempts.
            No real malicious activity or harmful content is involved.
        </p>
